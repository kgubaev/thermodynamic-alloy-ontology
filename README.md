This ontology describes the material properties, obtained by the atomistic simulations in certain conditions.

Properties: bulk mechanical and thermal properties, e.g.: isobaric heat capacity, density, elastic moduli.

Conditions: pressure, temperature, deformation.

Exemplary CQ:
Is there any simulation result showing material property X in conditions Y? Where:

X = {density}

Z = {Pressure = 0 atm, Temperature = 300 Kelvin, Deformation=none}  

Answer is: the simulations of quality V conditions Z for which:
1) it exist a known formula connecting V <---> X
  and
2) conditions Z have non-empty intersection with Y
