This ontology describes the material properties, obtained by the atomistic simulations in certain conditions.

Properties: bulk mechanical and thermal properties, e.g.: isobaric heat capacity, density, elastic moduli
Conditions: pressure, temperature, deformation 

Exemplary CQ:
Is there any simulation result showing material property X in conditions Y? Where:

X = {density}
Z = {Pressure = 0 atm, Temperature = 300 Kelvin, Deformation=none}
